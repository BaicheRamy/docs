## Roles & Permissions

Emplorium supports multiple predefined roles:

- **Admin**: Full access to all settings, integrations, billing, and user management.
- **Manager**: Access to team assignments, analytics, and automation settings.
- **Agent**: Handles conversations, views basic customer info, cannot change settings.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to dashboards and customer activity.

Custom role permissions (coming soon) will allow you to define granular access control.

## Team Creation

To keep your workspace organized:

1. Go to the **Teams** tab under the same page
2. Click **Create Team**

Teams are useful for:

- Reporting and analytics grouping

## Best Practices

- Assign roles based on responsibility, not seniority
- Use teams to mirror your internal organization (e.g., support tiers, regions)
- Review user activity regularly for compliance and efficiency

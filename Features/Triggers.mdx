## What is a Trigger?

A **Trigger** is an event or condition that initiates a specific automation. It helps you automate actions like sending messages, tagging conversations, routing users, and more.

## Types of Triggers

### Event-Based Triggers

- When a new message is received
- When a conversation is closed or resolved
- When a visitor opens the chat widget

### Attribute-Based Triggers

- User attribute matches (e.g., plan = "Free")
- Channel type (e.g., WhatsApp or Email)
- Message content includes specific keywords

### Time-Based Triggers

- Trigger if no response in X minutes
- Trigger after a delay from message received or action taken

## What are Emplorium Triggers?

Triggers are a set of **Conditions** that, when met, execute specific **Actions**. They act as an automated "if this, then that" system for your customer interactions.

For example:

- **IF** a visitor spends more than 60 seconds on your pricing page, **THEN** automatically send them a message offering help.
- **IF** a visitor's country is "Germany" AND they are on a specific product page, **THEN** assign a "Germany Sales Lead" tag to their chat.

## Building a Trigger: Conditions & Actions

Creating a powerful trigger involves defining precise conditions and the actions Emplorium should take once those conditions are met.

### 1. **Conditions: Defining When a Trigger Fires**

Conditions are the "if" part of your trigger. You can combine multiple conditions using **AND/OR logic** to create highly specific targeting rules.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Visitor-Based Conditions">
    These conditions are based on the visitor's characteristics or behavior on your site.

    - <Icon icon="globe-pointer" /> **Visitor Page URL:** The specific URL the visitor is currently viewing.
    - <Icon icon="circle-dot" /> **Visitor Online:** Whether the visitor is currently active on your website.
    - <Icon icon="message-dots" /> **Visitor Sends a Message:** Triggers when the visitor sends _any_ message.
    - <Icon icon="calendar" /> **Days of the Week:**  Specific days when the trigger should be active.
    - <Icon icon="chart-network" /> **Visitor IP:**  The IP address of the visitor.
    - <Icon icon="square-user" /> **Visitor Name:**  The known name of the visitor (requires data to be saved).
    - <Icon icon="envelope" /> **Visitor Email:**  The known email of the visitor (requires data to be saved).
    - <Icon icon="phone" /> **Visitor Phone:**  The known phone number of the visitor (requires data to be saved).\*
    - <Icon icon="desktop" /> **Browser Name:**  The web browser the visitor is using (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
    - <Icon icon="code-branch" /> **Browser Version:**  The specific version of the visitor's browser.
    - <Icon icon="gear" /> **OS Name:**  The operating system of the visitor's device (e.g., Windows, macOS, Android).
    - <Icon icon="mobile" /> **Device Type:**  The type of device (e.g., Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).
    - <Icon icon="flag" /> **Visitor Country:**  The detected country of the visitor based on IP address.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent-Based Conditions">
    These conditions are based on the availability of your agents.

    - <Icon icon="user-check" /> **If Agent Online:** Triggers if at least one agent is currently online.
    - <Icon icon="user-slash" /> **If Agent Offline:** Triggers if no agents are currently online.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Conditions that rely on "visitor values" (e.g., Name, Email, Phone) will only work if that data has already been collected and saved to the visitor's profile (e.g., via a form in a Flow or manual input by an agent).
</Note>

### 2. **Actions: What the Trigger Does**

Actions are the "then that" part of your trigger, executed when all specified conditions are met.

- <Icon icon="message-dots" /> **Send Auto Message:** Automatically sends a predefined message to the visitor. This message will be sent _every time_ the conditions are met.
- <Icon icon="comment-dots" /> **Send First Message:** Automatically sends a predefined message, but only _one time_ per visitor when the conditions are first met. Ideal for welcome messages or initial prompts.
- <Icon icon="tags" /> **Assign Tag:** Automatically applies a specific tag to the visitor's chat (e.g., `pricing-interest`, `abandoned-cart`).
- <Icon icon="user-tie" /> **Assign Agent:** Automatically assigns the chat to a specific agent.
- <Icon icon="building" /> **Assign Department:** Automatically assigns the chat to a specific department.

## Common Use Cases for Triggers

Triggers are incredibly versatile. Here are some ways you can leverage them to enhance your customer engagement:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Proactive Greetings & Onboarding" icon="comments-dollar">
    Trigger a personalized welcome message or an onboarding flow when a new visitor lands on your site or reaches a specific page for the first time.

    \_Example: If _`Visitor Page URL contains /onboarding`_, THEN \_`Send First Message: "Welcome! Need help getting started?"`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sales & Lead Qualification" icon="dollar-sign">
    Identify high-intent visitors and offer timely assistance to convert them into leads.

    Example: If `Visitor Page URL contains /pricing` AND `Time on Page &gt; 30 seconds`, THEN `Send Auto Message: "Our sales team is available to answer any questions about pricing!"`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Support & Self-Service" icon="life-ring">
    Guide visitors to relevant resources or connect them with support when they seem to be struggling.

    Example: If `Visitor Page URL is /troubleshooting` AND `Time on Page = 60 seconds`, THEN `Send First Message: "It looks like you're on our troubleshooting page. Can I help you find a solution?"`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Re-engaging Abandoned Sessions" icon="shop">
    Send a reminder or offer help to visitors who might be about to leave without completing a key action.

    Example: If `Visitor Page URL contains /checkout` AND `Visitor is Online is false` (after a short delay), THEN `Send First Message: "Did you encounter any issues with your checkout?"`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Localized Support" icon="map-location-dot">
    Route visitors to specific agents or departments based on their geographic location or language preference (when multi-language support is available).

    Example: If `Visitor Country is Germany`, THEN `Assign Department: "German Support"`
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Managing Your Triggers

- **Activation Status:** Easily toggle triggers `On` or `Off` as needed without deleting them.
- **Prioritization:** (Coming Soon) Set an order of priority for triggers, especially if multiple conditions could overlap.
- **Testing:** Utilize the **Virtual Visitor** feature to test your trigger configurations in a sandbox environment before deploying them live.

## Best Practices for Effective Trigger Usage

<Tip>
  To get the most out of Emplorium Triggers, consider these best practices:
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Simple">
    Begin with one or two clear triggers to get comfortable with the functionality. Avoid overly complex `AND/OR` logic initially.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Clear Goals">
    Before creating a trigger, identify what you want to achieve (e.g., reduce bounce rate on a specific page, increase demo requests).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Avoid Overwhelm">
    Don't bombard your visitors with too many messages. Use `Send First Message` for initial prompts and ensure your auto messages provide genuine value.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Thoroughly">
    Always use the \<Icon icon="user-secret" /\> **Virtual Visitor** to simulate scenarios and ensure your triggers fire as expected before going live. This prevents unintended messages or routing issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor & Refine">
    Regularly review the performance of your triggers. Are they achieving their goals? Do visitors respond positively? Adjust conditions and messages based on your analytics.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pair with Flows (Advanced)">
    For more complex interactions after a trigger fires (e.g., asking multiple questions, collecting specific data), consider using a [**Flow**](/Features/Flows) instead of a simple trigger.
  </Step>

## What are Triggers?

**Triggers** in Emplorium are conditions that automatically start flows or actions within the live chat environment. They allow you to proactively engage visitors, personalize experiences, and automate repetitive tasks without manual intervention.

Triggers can detect specific visitor behavior, timing, or data input and then launch predefined actions, such as sending a message, starting a flow, or assigning a tag.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Trigger Conditions**

Every trigger must be tied to at least one condition. Emplorium supports:

* **Page URL**: Detect if a visitor is on a specific page.
* **Time on Page**: Trigger after a certain number of seconds.
* **Referral Source**: Detect the source (e.g., Google, Facebook).
* **Scroll Depth**: Trigger when a user scrolls a certain %.
* **Device Type**: Differentiate between mobile, desktop, or tablet.
* **First-Time vs Returning Visitor**
* **Chat Inactivity**: Trigger if the visitor has been idle.
* **Campaign Tag**: Trigger if a visitor has a campaign-specific tag.
* **Utm Parameters**: Track and trigger based on marketing UTM parameters.

> ✅ You can combine multiple conditions using AND/OR logic.

### 2. **Trigger Actions**

Once a condition is met, you can define what action Emplorium takes. Available actions include:

* **Send a Message**: Display a proactive message to the visitor.
* **Start a Flow**: Automatically launch a specific automation flow.
* **Assign a Tag**: Tag the visitor for future targeting.
* **Open Form**: Prompt a specific form for lead capture or feedback.
* **Route to Team**: Assign the conversation to a particular team or agent group.
* **Update Profile**: Dynamically modify visitor data fields.

## Managing Triggers

Triggers are managed from **Settings → Triggers**. Each trigger has:

* **Name**: Internal title for easy reference.
* **Status Toggle**: Enable or disable individual triggers.
* **Condition Builder**: A visual tool to combine conditions.
* **Action Selector**: Dropdown to select the desired action.
* **Preview/Test Tool**: See the trigger in action before publishing.

## Best Practices

* **Keep Conditions Simple**: Use the fewest necessary conditions to avoid complexity.
* **Preview Before Launching**: Always test your triggers to make sure they fire correctly.
* **Use Tags for Segmentation**: Tag visitors based on trigger logic for easier follow-up.
* **Monitor Engagement Metrics**: Track which triggers convert and which don’t.

## Use Cases

### Abandonment Recovery

If a visitor lingers on the checkout page for 45 seconds without interaction:

* **Trigger**: Page URL + Time on Page
* **Action**: Send message “Need help checking out?”

### Content Promotion

When a visitor arrives from a newsletter campaign:

* **Trigger**: Referral Source = Mailchimp + UTM = newsletter\_june
* **Action**: Launch a custom flow or welcome message.

### Lead Capture on Blog

If a visitor scrolls 75% of a blog post:

* **Trigger**: Page URL contains "/blog" + Scroll Depth 75%
* **Action**: Open form to capture email.

## What is a Customer Profile?

A customer profile is a centralized view of a user's information and history. It includes key attributes, conversation records, and custom data points.

- Understand who you're talking to
- Personalize conversations in real-time
- Track interaction history and preferences

## Profile Fields

Each profile includes:

- **Basic Info**: Name, email, phone number, location
- **Contact Activity**: Last seen, first seen, session count
- **Custom Attributes**: Add tags like plan type, language, user role, or subscription status
- **Conversation History**: View all past interactions across all channels

## Updating Profiles

- Auto-update based on integrations or workflows
- Use API to push or pull profile updates

## Segmentation with Attributes

Leverage profile attributes for:

- **Automation Triggers**: e.g., send message if plan = free
- **Audience Filtering**: for campaigns or reporting
- **Routing Logic**: assign to team based on language or tier

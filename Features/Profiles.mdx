## What are Profiles?

Profiles in Emplorium represent the individual visitors interacting with your chat widget. Each profile is dynamically created during a session and populated with available data from conversations, forms, and API updates. Profiles allow agents and Aura AI to deliver personalized, contextual experiences.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Session-Based Identification**
- Profiles are **not persistent across sessions**. If the same visitor returns via a different browser, device, or clears cookies, a new profile will be generated.
- No cross-device or long-term re-identification is performed.

### 2. **Data Sources**
- **Form Submissions**: Profile fields are auto-filled when users submit forms during chat interactions.
- **Manual Edits**: Agents can manually edit or add fields directly in the profile panel.
- **API Updates**: Data received from external APIs via Data Requests or Data Updates can also enrich the profile.

### 3. **Field Customization**
- Admins can configure custom profile fields (text, number, date, dropdown) in **Settings → Profiles**.
- These fields can be mapped to form inputs or external data.

## Profile Components

### Basic Info Panel
- Name, Email, Phone, Location (if available from form or IP).
- Metadata like browser type, operating system, and first seen timestamp.

### Custom Fields
- Configurable fields per your business needs (e.g. plan type, region, loyalty score).
- Used in Flows, Triggers, or personalizing AI responses.

### Conversation History
- Linked to the profile for real-time agent and AI reference.
- Helps in providing continuity during ongoing chats.

## Profile Editing

### By Agents:
- Agents can edit any profile field directly from the right-side profile panel during a chat.
- Useful for correcting or enhancing missing information on-the-fly.

### By AI:
- Aura AI can suggest updates or automatically store form-submitted info to profiles.
- Only updates fields explicitly configured in the profile schema.

## Use Cases

- **Lead Qualification**: Enrich profiles with form data or API checks (e.g. CRM match).
- **AI Personalization**: Aura references profile values when answering (e.g. "Hi John, your plan is Premium.")
- **Routing & Automation**: Trigger Flows based on profile attributes (e.g. VIP tier, location).

---

## Privacy Considerations

- **Temporary Storage**: Profiles are short-lived and reset with new sessions.
- **Manual Deletion**: Agents can clear profile data manually if requested by the user.
- **No Persistent Tracking**: The system avoids any long-term tracking in compliance with privacy regulations.

---

## Future Improvements (Planned)

- **Persistent Profiles**: Ability to link returning users based on login or CRM match.
- **Profile Export/Import**: Admins will be able to export profile data for analysis or import predefined profiles.
- **Profile Segments**: Create segments based on profile attributes for tailored Flows and AI behavior.

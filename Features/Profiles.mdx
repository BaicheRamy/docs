title: "Profiles"
description: "Emplorium creates a unique profile for each visitor interacting with your chat widget. This profile is continuously enriched with data collected during the session â€“ through conversations, forms, and API updates. While current profiles are session-based, they are vital for delivering contextual and informed support during an active chat."

## What are Emplorium Profiles?

A visitor profile is a temporary digital record that aggregates key information about an active user. Think of it as a snapshot of who your customer is _right now_ in their current interaction, providing valuable context for your team.

## Key Concepts

Understanding these core concepts is essential for leveraging Emplorium's profile functionality effectively.

### 1. **Session-Based Identification**

<Warning>
  Currently, Emplorium profiles are **not persistent across sessions**.
</Warning>

This means:

- If the same visitor returns via a different browser, device, or clears their cookies, a new, separate profile will be generated for that new session.
- Emplorium does **not** perform cross-device or long-term re-identification of visitors. \</Callout\> Each profile is tied to a specific session. If a visitor closes their browser and reopens it, or uses a different device, they will be identified as a "new" visitor in Emplorium, and a new profile will be created.

### 2. Dynamic Data Sources

Profile fields are populated and updated from various sources during an active session:

- **Form Submissions:** When visitors submit forms within the chat widget (e.g., pre-chat forms, forms sent via Flows or by agents), their responses automatically populate relevant profile fields.
- **Manual Agent Edits:** Agents can directly edit or add information to profile fields from the right-side profile panel during an active conversation.
- **API Updates (Data Updates):** Data received from your external systems via configured Data Update (POST/PUT) API calls can enrich profile fields.
- **System-Generated Data:** Emplorium automatically collects basic metadata like IP address, browser type, operating system, and the time of their first visit in the current session.

### 3. Customizable Profile Fields

Admins have full control over defining custom profile fields to capture the specific data relevant to their business.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Settings">
    Navigate to `Settings > Chat Settings > Data fields`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Data Field">
    Click "Create a new Datafield". You'll need to provide:

    - **Name:** (e.g., `customer_segment`)
    - **Label:** (e.g., `Customer Segment`)
    - **Format:** Choose the input type (Text, Textarea, Select, Radio, Checkbox).
    - **Validation (Optional):** Include regex for Text fields if specific format validation is required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map to Forms & Flows">
    These custom fields can then be used in:

    - **Forms:** When creating a form, you can select these data fields to gather specific information from visitors.
    - **Flows:** Data collected via forms in a Flow can directly update these profile fields using the "Send Form" block.
    - **Aura AI:** Aura AI can reference these fields for personalized responses.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Profile Components in the Inbox

When viewing an active conversation in the Inbox, the right-side panel (Visitor Details) provides a comprehensive view of the visitor's profile.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Profile Tab">
    This section summarizes core visitor information and custom attributes:

    - **Basic Details:** Includes the Department the chat is assigned to, Priority (set by agent), and current Assignee(s).
    - **Attributes:** Displays all custom profile fields you've defined, populated with data.
    - **Visitor Data Device:** An expandable section with technical details like Time on Site, Browser, Device Type (desktop/laptop), IP address, and Country.
    - \*\*Notes: \*\*Allows agents to add internal, private notes about this specific user that are visible only to other agents.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Browse History Tab">
    Provides a chronological audit log of the visitor's navigation within your targeted website during their current session, tracking the URLs they've visited.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Previous Conversations Tab (Coming Soon)">
    Lists all past chats this specific visitor has had in the app _within the same session_ or if their session was somehow preserved. Clicking an entry loads the full historical conversation view.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Profiles are Updated

Profiles are dynamic and can be enriched throughout a conversation:

### By Agents

- Agents can directly edit any profile field from the **Visitor Details (right panel)** during an active chat. This is invaluable for correcting inaccuracies, adding missing information, or enriching details on the fly based on conversation context. #include_picture_of_agent_editing_profile

### By Aura AI

- **Form Submissions:** Aura AI can automatically store information submitted by the user through forms (e.g., via a `Send Form` block in a Flow) directly into the configured profile fields.
- **Data Updates:** If Aura is configured to trigger a [Data Update (POST/PUT)](/Advanced/DataRequest&Update) API call, it can update profile fields with information received from your external systems.
- Aura only updates fields that are explicitly configured within your profile schema.

## Strategic Use Cases for Profiles (Current & Future)

Leveraging profiles enhances personalization and automation:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Real-Time Lead Qualification" icon="clipboard-check">
    Enrich profiles with form data collected in pre-chat forms or Flows. For example, ask about company size or specific needs, and use that profile data to trigger a `Tag Chat` action.
  </Card>
  <Card title="In-Session AI Personalization" icon="robot">
    Aura AI can reference profile values during a conversation to provide personalized answers (e.g., "Hi [Visitor Name], it looks like your current plan is [Plan Type]. How can I help?").
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Routing & Automation" icon="route">
    Use profile attributes (e.g., `department_interest`, `product_tier`) as conditions in your [<u>Triggers</u> ](/Features/Triggers)or [<u>Flows</u> ](/Features/Flows)to route chats to the correct department or agent, or to initiate specific automated messages.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Privacy Considerations

Emplorium takes data privacy seriously.

- **Temporary Storage:** Current profiles are designed to be short-lived, primarily providing context for the ongoing session.
- **No Persistent Tracking:** The system, in its current form, avoids long-term, cross-session tracking of individual users for compliance and privacy.
- **Manual Deletion:** Agents have the ability to clear specific profile data manually within the Inbox if a user requests it.

## Future Improvements (Planned)

We are continuously evolving Emplorium's profile capabilities to empower even deeper personalization and data management:

- **Persistent Profiles:** The ability to link returning users based on secure login identifiers or CRM matches, enabling a consistent view of customer history across multiple sessions.
- **Profile Export/Import:** Functionality for Admins to export profile data for external analysis or import predefined customer profiles into Emplorium.
- **Profile Segments:** The ability to create dynamic segments based on various profile attributes, allowing for highly targeted Flows, Triggers, and AI behaviors.

<Update label="06/21/2025" description>
  **Planned Release:** Persistent Profiles are a high-priority item on our roadmap for Q1 2026.

## Overview

Emplorium offers powerful integration capabilities to extend the platform's functionality and align it with your existing tools. Whether you're connecting to a CRM, marketing tool, automation service, or using custom APIs, Emplorium provides a seamless integration layer across multiple channels.

There are three main types of integrations within Emplorium:

- **Third-party integrations** (e.g., HubSpot, Mailchimp, Slack)
- **Custom API-based integrations** (Data Requests and Data Updates)
- **Webhooks for event-driven workflows**

## 1. Third-party Integrations

Emplorium supports direct connections with popular business tools and platforms, including:

- **CRM Tools**: Salesforce, HubSpot
- **Marketing Platforms**: Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign
- **Communication Channels**: Slack, Microsoft Teams
- **Automation Tools**: Zapier, Make (Integromat)

### How to Set Up:

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations**
2. Choose your desired tool from the available list
3. Authenticate using OAuth or API key (based on provider)
4. Map fields or event triggers if required
5. Save and activate the integration

Once integrated, these platforms can:

- Share contact data
- Trigger messages based on external campaign actions
- Notify internal channels of user activity
- Automate data logging and CRM updates

## 2. API-Based Integrations

This is one of Emplorium's most flexible and powerful integration mechanisms.

### a. **Data Requests**

Allow Aura AI to query external data based on specific user intents or keywords.

- Use case: Retrieve order status, fetch CRM record, etc.
- Configured via **Settings → Data Requests**
- Requires endpoint URL, method, and optional headers/params

Example:

- Trigger phrase: “Check my delivery”
- API endpoint: `GET /orders/:orderId`
- Result is shown in the live chat thread as a formatted AI response

### b. **Data Updates**

Enable Aura AI to send data or trigger changes in external systems via keyword-based logic.

- Use case: Update ticket status, submit form data, etc.
- Configured via **Settings → Data Updates**
- Define the endpoint, method (POST/PUT), and payload structure

These integrations are AI-aware, meaning Aura can dynamically choose which API to call based on detected intent.

## 3. Webhooks

Webhooks allow Emplorium to push real-time events to external systems.

### Example Events:

- New chat message
- AI fallback trigger
- Form submission
- User rated conversation

### Setup Steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Webhooks**
2. Click **Add Webhook**
3. Define the receiving endpoint URL
4. Select which events should trigger the webhook
5. Save

Payloads are sent as `application/json` and can be used to:

- Trigger Zapier automations
- Notify backend systems
- Log events to analytics

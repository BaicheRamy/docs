## Overview of Integration Types

Emplorium offers three primary methods for connecting with your broader software ecosystem:

1. **Direct Third-Party Integrations:** Pre-built connections with popular CRMs, marketing platforms, and communication tools.
2. **API-Based Integrations (Data Requests & Updates):** Highly flexible custom connections to pull or push data from virtually any external system.
3. **Webhooks:** Real-time event notifications sent from Emplorium to other applications.There are three main types of integrations within Emplorium:

## 1. Direct Third-Party Integrations

Emplorium provides direct, out-of-the-box connections with commonly used business applications, simplifying data synchronization and workflow automation

### Common Actions After Integration

Once connected, these platforms can enable:

- **Contact Data Sharing:** Syncing new leads or customer updates.
- **Campaign Triggering:** Initiating email sequences based on chat activity.
- **Internal Notifications:** Sending alerts to team channels for specific chat events.
- **Automated Logging:** Automatically pushing chat transcripts or key details to your CRM.s

## 2. API-Based Integrations: Data Requests & Data Updates

Emplorium's API-based integrations are incredibly flexible, allowing Aura AI to interact with virtually any external system capable of sending or receiving data via an API. These are configured directly within Emplorium.

### a. Data Requests (GET)

<Tip>
  **Purpose:** Retrieve information from an external system based on a user's query or a Flow's logic. Aura AI can then present this information in the chat.
</Tip>

- **Use Cases:**
  - Retrieve a customer's order status from your e-commerce platform.
  - Fetch a user's account details from your CRM.
  - Query product availability or pricing from your inventory system.
- **Configuration:** Configured via `Settings > For Developers > Data Request`
  - You define the API endpoint URL, HTTP method (`GET`), and any required headers, query parameters, or body parameters.
- **Aura AI Integration:** You can train Aura AI to automatically trigger specific Data Requests when certain keywords or user intents are detected in the chat. \
  _Example: If user says "What's my order status?", Aura could trigger a GET request to your order system and display the status directly in the chat._

### b. Data Updates (POST/PUT)

<Tip>
  **Purpose:** Send information from Emplorium to an external system, or trigger an action in an external system. Aura AI or a Flow can initiate these updates.
</Tip>

- **Use Cases:**
  - Update a customer's profile in your CRM based on information collected in a chat form.
  - Submit a new support ticket to your helpdesk system.
  - Change a subscription status in your billing system.
- **Configuration:** Defined via `Settings > For Developers > Data Update`
  - You specify the API endpoint URL, HTTP method (`POST` or `PUT`), and the structure of the payload (the data) that Emplorium will send.
- **Aura AI & Flow Integration:** Data Updates can be triggered by Aura AI based on intent, or explicitly within a [Flow](https://www.google.com/search?q=/features/flows%23send-data-update-block) using the "Send Data Update" block. \
  _Example: After collecting feedback via a form in a Flow, the Flow triggers a POST request to your survey tool's API to record the feedback._

<Note>
  These API-based integrations are "AI-aware," meaning Aura can intelligently decide which API call to make based on its understanding of the conversation's intent.
</Note>

## 3. Webhooks: Event-Driven Automation

Webhooks provide a real-time, lightweight way for Emplorium to notify other applications about specific events occurring within the platform.

<Warning>
  Webhooks are still under constructions, we'll be adding those very soon\!
</Warning>

### How Webhooks Work

When a predefined event happens in Emplorium (e.g., a new message, a chat is resolved), Emplorium will send an HTTP POST request to a URL you specify. This request contains a JSON payload with details about the event.

### Example Events that Can Trigger a Webhook

- `chat.new_message`: A new message is sent in any chat.
- `aura.fallback_triggered`: Aura AI could not confidently answer a user's query.
- `form.submitted`: A visitor submits a form through the chat widget or a Flow.
- `conversation.resolved`: A chat conversation is marked as resolved by an agent.
- `kba.article_rated`: A visitor rates a Knowledge Base Article. \<br/\> _(Note: The exact event names are defined in your webhook settings.)_

### Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Webhooks">
    Go to `Settings > For Developers > Webhooks`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add New Webhook">
    Click the `Add Webhook` button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Endpoint URL">
    Enter the **receiving URL** where Emplorium should send the event payload. This is typically an endpoint on your own server or an automation platform like Zapier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Events">
    Choose which specific Emplorium events should trigger this webhook (e.g., `New Chat Message`, `Aura Fallback`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save & Test">
    Save your webhook. It's highly recommended to test it to ensure the payload is received correctly by your external system.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. **Behavioral Customization**

<Note>
  To be added\!
</Note>

Control the widget's presence and how it prompts visitors.

- **Show/Hide Rules:** Define when the widget should appear based on visitor actions or page URLs (often managed via **Triggers**).
- **Delay Settings:** Configure a delay (e.g., 5 seconds) before the widget appears on a page to avoid immediately interrupting visitors.
- **Re-open Rules:** Set how the widget behaves if a visitor closes it and then navigates to another page or returns to your site.

<Note>
  While some basic display rules are in Widget Settings, advanced behavioral control (like proactive messages based on user actions) is primarily configured within the [Triggers](/Features/Triggers) feature.
</Note>

## How Visitors Interact with the Widget

When a visitor lands on your website, the Emplorium Chat Widget provides an intuitive user experience:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial State (Minimized)">
    By default, the widget appears minimized on your website (unless you've configured it to open automatically via a trigger). Its branding and initial appearance are controlled by your widget settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Opening the Widget">
    Visitors click the widget icon to expand it. They are greeted by your customized welcome message and presented with options like "Send us a Message" or Browse "Useful Articles"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Engaging with Content">
    From the expanded widget, visitors can: 

    - **Start a New Conversation:** Initiate a chat with your team or Aura AI.  
    - **View Old Messages:** Access their historical chat conversations with your business.  
    - **Browse Articles:** Navigate through your Knowledge Base categories or search for specific information.  
    - **Interact with Aura AI:** Engage with your AI agent for instant answers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seamless Conversation">
    Once a chat begins, visitors experience real-time messaging with rich media support. If Aura AI is enabled, it provides instant replies, escalating to a human agent if needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What is the Emplorium Chat Widget?

The Emplorium Chat Widget is an embeddable interface that allows visitors on your website or application to communicate with your team in real time. It provides a seamless bridge between your customers and your support, sales, or AI agent (Aura). Built for flexibility and ease of use, it supports deep customization, AI integration, and multi-device responsiveness.

## Key Features

* Supports rich text, attachments (images, files), and links.
* Instant delivery indicators (sent, delivered, seen).
* Supports multi-language communication (configurable per account).

### 2. **AI-Powered Assistance (Aura AI)**

* AI agent can respond autonomously to user queries.
* Trained via documents, Q\&A, data fields, APIs, and company settings.
* Auto-detects user intent and performs actions (like sending data requests or updates).
* Supports fallback and escalation to live agents.

### 3. **Customizable Design**

* Modify widget colors, welcome messages, language, default agent avatar, and widget position.
* Display options for mobile vs. desktop.

* User context maintained across conversations.

### 8. **Session Management**

## Installation Options

You can install the chat widget on any major platform or framework:

* React / Angular / Vue / Next.js via SDK
* CMS & eCommerce platforms (WordPress, Shopify, Wix, Webflow, Framer)

Visit the [Installation & Integration Guide](/installation/integration) for step-by-step setup.

## How Users See the Widget

* On load, the widget is minimized by default (unless set to open automatically).
* Branding and first-message appearance is controlled via settings.
* Users can reply to previous conversations, start a new one, or interact with Aura.

## Use Cases

* **Customer Support**: Offer quick help and resolve issues in real time.
* **Lead Qualification**: Use forms and AI to identify high-intent visitors.

## Best Practices

* Keep the welcome message warm and brief.
* Enable Aura for 24/7 coverage, especially during non-business hours.
* Customize form fields to reduce friction.

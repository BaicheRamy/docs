## Overview

Emplorium's **Knowledge Base** allows you to create a centralized hub of help articles, FAQs, and documentation that can be:

- Referenced by the Aura AI Agent for instant support responses
- Indexed by the search box in your live chat widget
- Organized into categories for user browsing

Knowledge Articles are essential to power **AI understanding**, reduce agent workload, and improve customer satisfaction.

## How It Works

Knowledge Base content is used by Emplorium in the following ways:

- **AI Training Source**: Aura AI reads all published articles and uses their contents to formulate answers when users ask related questions.
- **Searchable Widget**: Visitors can search articles from the chat widget interface.
- **Team Resource**: Agents can link and send articles directly in conversations.

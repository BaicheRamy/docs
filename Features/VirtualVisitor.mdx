## What is the Virtual Visitor and Why Use It?

Think of the Virtual Visitor as a built-in, interactive simulator of your Emplorium chat widget. It runs your current configurations in isolation, allowing you to:

- **Catch errors early:** Identify and fix issues before they impact real customers.
- **Iterate rapidly:** Make changes and instantly see their effect.
- **Ensure consistency:** Verify that your customer experience is uniform across different scenarios.
- **Validate complex logic:** Test intricate Triggers and multi-step Flows.

## üß™ Key Use Cases

The Virtual Visitor empowers you to thoroughly test every aspect of your Emplorium setup:

  <Card title="Test Your Widget Setup" icon="brush">
    Instantly see how your chat widget looks and behaves with your latest customizations.

    - _- Verify appearance, brand colors, and placement on the screen._
    - _- _Check responsiveness across different simulated device types (e.g., toggle light/dark mode). 
    - - Observe how the widget behaves on initial load or message.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simulate Triggers & Conditions" icon="bolt">
    Ensure your proactive messages and automated actions fire correctly under specific conditions.

    - - Enter simulated URLs (e.g., `/pricing`, `/contact`) to see page-based triggers activate. 


    - - Simulate referrers, device types, or visitor attributes (e.g., IP address, country). 
    - - Watch Flows launch when their start conditions are matched.
    - - Evaluate fallback behavior if a trigger's conditions are unmet.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Preview Flows & Forms" icon="diagram-project">
    Walk through any multi-step Flow you've configured, just as a user would.

    - - Fill out forms as a mock user to validate data collection and field updates.
    - - Observe how the Flow progresses based on your simulated responses.
    - - Trigger follow-up messages or external [Data Requests/Updates](/Advanced/DataRequest&Update) initiated by the Flow.
    - - Validate dynamic message personalization (e.g., ensuring `{{first_name}}` is populated correctly).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Aura AI Accuracy" icon="robot">
    Engage directly with your Aura AI assistant in a controlled environment.

    - - Test how Aura responds to various queries based on your trained [Knowledge Base Articles](/Features/KBAs) and [Q&A pairs](/Features/AuraAi).
    - - Track Aura's fallback tagging (`#fallback`) and evaluate its intent recognition.
    - - Rapidly iterate on Aura's training data with immediate visible responses.
    - 
    - 
  </Card>
  <Card title="Run Data Requests & Updates" icon="plug">
    Verify the integration of your external API calls within Flows or Aura AI.

    - - Simulate scenarios that trigger [Data Requests](/Advanced/DataRequest&Update) (GET) to pull product or order data and inspect the response.
    - - Test [Data Updates](/Advanced/DataRequest&Update) (POST/PUT) to ensure data is sent correctly to your external systems or webhooks are fired.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use the Virtual Visitor

Accessing and using the Virtual Visitor is straightforward:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the Virtual Visitor">
    From the Emplorium home page and on the visitor table, click on the <Icon icon="circle-plus" /> **New Virtual Visitor **button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interact with the Widget Preview">
    A preview of your Emplorium chat widget will launch in the center-right panel of your screen. This is your interactive sandbox.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simulate Page Visits">
    Use the **URL bar** located above the widget preview to simulate a visitor navigating to different pages on your website (e.g., type `/about`, `/contact`, `/pricing`, or any specific path). This is crucial for testing URL-based Triggers and Flows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Typing & Interacting">
    Begin typing messages into the widget input area. Engage with it as a real customer would to test responses, Flow progression, Aura AI behavior, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Utilize Control Options">
    The Virtual Visitor panel includes helpful controls:

    - **Toggle Light/Dark Mode:** Test your widget's appearance in different themes_. _
    - **Refresh/Reset Session:** Clear the current session to start fresh and re-test initial load behaviors.  
    - **Track Fallbacks:** Monitor how often Aura AI encounters situations it cannot resolve. 
    - **Inspect Unresolved Queries:** Review queries that Aura couldn't answer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## üîç Best Practices for Effective Testing

<Tip>
  Integrate the Virtual Visitor into your workflow to ensure maximum reliability and polish for your customer engagement.
</Tip>

- **Always Test New Configurations:** Make it a rule to thoroughly test all new [Flows](/Features/Flows) and [Triggers](/Features/Triggers) in the Virtual Visitor before publishing them live.
- **Verify Aura AI Training:** Use diverse test messages to check the coverage of your AI's training data, including different phrasing and edge cases, and monitor for fallback triggers.
- **Validate Forms & Integrations:** Simulate filling out forms and ensure that data is correctly collected and that any associated external API calls ([Data Requests](/Advanced/DataRequest&Update) or [Data Updates](/Advanced/DataRequest&Update)) function as expected.
- **Check Responsiveness & Accessibility:** Briefly test the widget's appearance and usability across different simulated screen sizes (if available in the tool) and widget themes.
- **Simulate User Paths:** Don't just test individual features. Try to simulate common customer journeys from start to finish to ensure a seamless experience.

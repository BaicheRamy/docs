## Unified Inbox Overview

Emplorium provides a centralized Inbox where all customer interactions are gathered into a single streamlined view. This includes messages from:

* **Live Chat** (via the website widget)
* **Third-party channels** (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or other platforms via integrations)
* **Internal Notes** (between teammates)
* **Bot-generated messages** (by Aura AI)

The unified inbox ensures every conversation is accessible in one place with clear threading and historical context.

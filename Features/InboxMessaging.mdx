### 1. **Conversations List (Left Panel)**

This panel provides an organized overview of all your customer and internal team conversations.

    This tab displays all conversations you have with visitors, including those you've picked up, or those routed to your department awaiting assignment.

    <br />

    - "**Pending Messages**": Conversations that are awaiting an agent's response or assignment.
    - "**Direct Messages**": Conversations where you are actively engaged as an assignee.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agents Tab">
    This tab manages your internal team communications.

    <br />

### 2. **Active Conversation (Middle Panel)**

This is where real-time interactions unfold, displaying the full chat thread and enabling immediate responses.

  - <Icon icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" /> **Transfer Visitor**: Re-route the conversation to another department or specific agent. A reason for transfer is required. Upon transfer, a message "Agent X transferred Chat" appears in the conversation, and previous agents automatically leave the chat.

  - <Icon icon="ban" /> **Ban Visitor**: Blocks the visitor's IP address, preventing further access to the chat widget. (Coming Soon: <Icon icon="phone" /> Audio Call & <Icon icon="video" /> Video Call - currently grayed out)

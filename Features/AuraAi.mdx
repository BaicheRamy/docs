## Data Sources Aura Learns From

Aura is trained on the following sources:

- **Chat History**: It continuously learns from past interactions during a session.
- **Links & Articles**: Add URLs and internal articles to be parsed into its knowledge.
- **Q&A Pairs**: Define direct question-answer examples.
- **Company Settings**: Includes business name, timezone, contact rules, and language preferences.
- **Data Fields**: All fields collected via forms or populated manually.
- **Data Requests**: External API queries Aura can run when specific keywords are detected (e.g., "order status").
- **Data Updates**: API calls to update records, triggered by user actions or AI interpretation.

## How It Works During a Chat

1. **User Message Received**
2. **Aura Matches Intent / Keyword**
   - If match found in Q&A, it replies.
   - If match found in keyword-based data request, it fetches external info.
   - If ambiguous or unknown, it applies fallback logic.
3. **Contextual Memory**
   - Retains session context (fields submitted, articles referenced, message trail).
4. **Escalation or Follow-Up**
   - If answer not found after multiple replies, it tags the message with `#fallback` and follows escalation rules.

## Fallback & Escalation Handling

- **Fallback Tags**: When Aura cannot confidently respond, it tags the message with `#fallback`.
- **Unanswered Count Tracking**: You can configure Aura to count how many fallback-tagged messages occur per session.
- **Agent Escalation**: After X fallbacks, Aura prompts the user with options like:
  - "Talk to a person"
  - "That didn't help? Let me connect you."

## Visibility Settings

You can control how Aura behaves per route or page:

- **Auto Visible on Load**
- **Delay Appearance**
- **Visible Only When Triggered**
- **Hidden on Specific URLs**

<Note>
  **Use case example: **Hide Aura during checkout or onboarding flows.
</Note>

## Best Practices

- Regularly update linked articles and Q&A pairs.
- Keep API responses fast—Aura expects responses under 3 seconds.
- Use fallback tracking to identify gaps in knowledge.
- Train with real customer queries via the chat history tool.

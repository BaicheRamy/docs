## Overview

Aura AI is Emplorium’s intelligent assistant designed to automate and enhance conversations with your website visitors. It learns from various data sources, understands context, handles queries in real-time, and gracefully escalates to human agents when needed.

## What Makes Aura AI Powerful

* **Context-Aware Responses**: Aura AI uses session context, conversation history, and configured knowledge to generate smart replies.
* **Multi-Source Learning**: Trains on your documents, articles, links, chat history, form values, company settings, and both external API data requests and data updates.
* **Keyword Matching + Intent Detection**: Recognizes user intents via keyword triggers or detected meaning.
* **Smart Escalation Rules**: Supports fallback tagging, human hand-off, and unanswered question tracking.
* **Customizable Behaviors**: Responses, escalation logic, and visibility can be fine-tuned per use case.

## Data Sources Aura Learns From

Aura is trained on the following sources:

* **Chat History**: It continuously learns from past interactions during a session.
* **Links & Articles**: Add URLs and internal articles to be parsed into its knowledge.
* **Q\&A Pairs**: Define direct question-answer examples.
* **Company Settings**: Includes business name, timezone, contact rules, and language preferences.
* **Data Fields**: All fields collected via forms or populated manually.
* **Data Requests**: External API queries Aura can run when specific keywords are detected (e.g., "order status").
* **Data Updates**: API calls to update records, triggered by user actions or AI interpretation.

## How It Works During a Chat

1. **User Message Received**
2. **Aura Matches Intent / Keyword**

   * If match found in Q\&A, it replies.
   * If match found in keyword-based data request, it fetches external info.
   * If ambiguous or unknown, it applies fallback logic.
3. **Contextual Memory**

   * Retains session context (fields submitted, articles referenced, message trail).
4. **Escalation or Follow-Up**

   * If answer not found after multiple replies, it tags the message with `#fallback` and follows escalation rules.

## Fallback & Escalation Handling

* **Fallback Tags**: When Aura cannot confidently respond, it tags the message with `#fallback`.
* **Unanswered Count Tracking**: You can configure Aura to count how many fallback-tagged messages occur per session.
* **Agent Escalation**: After X fallbacks, Aura prompts the user with options like:

  * "Talk to a person"
  * "That didn't help? Let me connect you."

## Visibility Settings

You can control how Aura behaves per route or page:

* **Auto Visible on Load**
* **Delay Appearance**
* **Visible Only When Triggered**
* **Hidden on Specific URLs**

Use case example: Hide Aura during checkout or onboarding flows.

## Best Practices

* Regularly update linked articles and Q\&A pairs.
* Keep API responses fast—Aura expects responses under 3 seconds.
* Use fallback tracking to identify gaps in knowledge.
* Train with real customer queries via the chat history tool.

## Roadmap (What’s Coming Next)

* **Multi-language fallback training**
* **Live memory inspection for debugging**
* **Personalized summaries at session end**
* **Automated tagging based on sentiment**
* **Time-based triggers for proactive outreach**

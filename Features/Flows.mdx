Unlike simple triggers, Flows enable you to guide visitors through structured conversations, collect specific information, perform actions, and ensure they reach the right outcome, whether it's self-service via Aura AI or a seamless handoff to a human agent."

## What are Emplorium Flows?

A Flow is a sequence of modular blocks that define a conversational path. You design these paths using an intuitive drag-and-drop builder, allowing for complex logic and personalized visitor experiences.

Flows are typically initiated by a **Start Condition** (similar to a Trigger) and then progress through various **Action Blocks** based on visitor input or predefined logic.

## Building a Flow: Start Conditions & Modular Blocks

Creating a Flow involves two main components: defining when the Flow should begin and assembling the series of actions and questions it will execute.

### 1. **Start Conditions: Initiating a Flow**

A Flow can be initiated by various visitor actions or environmental factors. These conditions determine when your automated journey begins.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Visitor Behavior & Presence">
    - <Icon icon="globe-pointer" /> **_When Visitor Lands on a Page:_** Starts when a visitor arrives on a specified URL. 
    - <Icon icon="circle-dot" /> **When Visitor is Online:** Triggers if the visitor is actively Browse your site.
    - <Icon icon="message-dots" /> **_When Visitor Sends a Message:_** Initiates the Flow when the visitor sends any message in the chat.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Scheduled & Time-Based">
    - <Icon icon="calendar" /> **On Scheduled Days:** Allows Flows to run on specific days of the week.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Visitor Identification & Attributes">
    - <Icon icon="chart-network" /> **_From a Specific IP Range:_** Targets visitors from a defined IP address range. 
    - <Icon icon="square-user" /> **For Identified Visitors:** Triggers for visitors whose profiles are known.
    - <Icon icon="envelope" /> **_For Known Emails:_** Initiates for visitors whose email addresses are recorded. 
    - <Icon icon="phone" /> **For Verified Phone Numbers:** Starts for visitors with known phone numbers. 
    - <Icon icon="flag" /> **Based on Visitor Country:** Triggers based on the visitor's detected country.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Device & Browser Specificity">
    - <Icon icon="desktop" /> **_For Specific Browsers:_** Targets users based on their web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). 
    - <Icon icon="code-branch" /> **For Certain Browser Versions:** Targets users with specific browser versions.
    - <Icon icon="gear" /> **_For Specific Operating Systems:_** Triggers for users on particular operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS). 
    - <Icon icon="mobile" /> **Based on Device Type:** Initiates for users on Desktop, Mobile, or Tablet devices.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent Availability">
    - <Icon icon="user-check" /> **_When Agents Are Online:_** Triggers if at least one agent is available. 
    - <Icon icon="user-slash" /> **When Agents Are Offline:** Triggers if no agents are currently online.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Start conditions for Flows are very similar to those for Triggers. You can think of a Flow as a more advanced, multi-step "action" that a simple Trigger might initiate.

### 2. **Modular Blocks: Designing the Conversation Path**

Once a Flow starts, you connect various modular blocks to create the desired user journey. These blocks represent different actions or interactions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Send Message">
    This block allows the Flow to send a message to the visitor.

    **Options:** Text, rich reply (with buttons), image, or quick reply options.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ask a Question (via bubbles)">
    This block sends a message and then pauses the Flow, waiting for a user reply to proceed. Useful for gathering specific input.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Send Form">
    Present a predefined form to the visitor. This can be used to set or update a profile field based on the collected conversation data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assign Aura AI">
    Directs the conversation to Aura AI, allowing the AI agent to handle the next set of user queries based on its knowledge.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Send Data Update">
    Push user-provided data or other information collected in the Flow to an external system via an API call (e.g., update a CRM record). Requires a configured [Data Update](https://www.google.com/search?q=/advanced-topics/data-requests-updates%23data-updates-post-put) endpoint.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Branch Logic">
    Create conditional branches in your Flow using `AND/OR` operators. This allows the Flow to take different paths based on visitor responses, profile data, or other criteria.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tag Chat">
    Automatically apply specific labels or tags to the chat based on user behavior or the outcome of the Flow. Useful for segmentation and reporting.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Escalate to Agent">
    Routes the conversation to a human agent when certain conditions are met (e.g., if the user asks for human help, or if the Flow can't resolve the issue).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="End Flow">
    Cleanly stops the Flow once a desired outcome is met or the conversation concludes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Designing Effective Flows: Use Cases & Strategy

Flows empower you to automate complex interactions that go beyond simple trigger-response mechanisms.

### Common Use Cases for Flows

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lead Qualification & Nurturing" icon="user-check">
    Build a multi-step conversation to ask qualifying questions (e.g., company size, pain points), collect contact info via forms, and then assign qualified leads to sales.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automated Support Triage" icon="question">
    Guide users through a series of questions to identify their issue, offer relevant KBA articles, and escalate to the correct department or agent if self-service isn't sufficient.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feedback Collection" icon="star">
    After a support interaction or a successful purchase, trigger a Flow to ask for feedback, collect ratings, and identify areas for improvement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Appointment Scheduling" icon="calendar">
    Combined with Data Requests/Updates) Allow users to book meetings or appointments directly within the chat by collecting necessary details and updating an external calendar system.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customer Onboarding & Feature Adoption" icon="person-walking-arrow-loop-left">
    Create interactive tours or mini-onboarding sequences. Ask users about their goals, provide quick tips, and direct them to relevant features or documentation.

## Managing & Testing Flows

- **Status Toggle:** Easily activate or deactivate Flows without deleting them.
- **Flow Performance Analytics (Coming Soon):** Gain insights into how your Flows are performing, including completion rates, drop-off points, and escalation rates.
- **Virtual Visitor:** Thoroughly test your Flows in a sandbox environment using the [Virtual Visitor](/Features/VirtualVisitor) to ensure they behave as expected before going live. This is crucial for complex flows.Ã¹

## Best Practices for Building Robust Flows

<Tip>
  Follow these guidelines to create effective and user-friendly Flows:
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Map Out the Journey First">
    Before building, sketch out the user's journey, decision points, and desired outcomes. This helps avoid getting lost in the visual builder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keep it Concise & Conversational">
    Design messages that are easy to read and natural. Avoid overly long messages or too many questions at once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Clear Options">
    When using "Ask a Question" or rich replies, give users clear, easy-to-understand options to guide them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design for Fallback & Escalation">
    Always include `Escalate to Agent` blocks at points where the Flow might not be able to resolve an issue, ensuring a smooth handoff.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Utilize Branch Logic Smartly">
    Use `Branch Logic` to personalize paths based on visitor input or known profile data, making the Flow more relevant.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Extensively with Virtual Visitor">
    Simulate every possible path and user input. Test edge cases, incorrect inputs, and the escalation process to catch errors early.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate & Optimize (with Analytics)">
    Once Flow performance analytics are available, use them to identify bottlenecks, optimize conversation paths, and improve conversion rates.
  </Step>

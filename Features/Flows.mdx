## What You Can Automate

- Auto-assign conversations to the right agent or team
- Send automated welcome or away messages
- Trigger workflows based on user behavior or message content
- Escalate or close conversations based on rules

## Getting Started with Automation

1. Go to **Settings → Automation**
2. Click **New Rule**
3. Define:
   - **Trigger**: What event starts the automation (e.g., new message received)
   - **Conditions**: Filters to narrow scope (e.g., if channel is WhatsApp)
   - **Actions**: What happens (e.g., assign to team, send message, tag conversation)

## Common Use Cases

- **Welcome Messages**: Send an automated greeting when someone opens the chat widget.
- **Offline Routing**: If all agents are offline, notify the user and assign to a follow-up queue.
- **Priority Tagging**: Automatically tag high-priority customers based on attributes.
- **Agent Escalation**: Reassign conversations if not responded to in X minutes.

## Key Flow Components

### 1. **Start Condition**

Every flow must begin with a condition. This can be:

- A Trigger event (e.g., "User says something containing X")
- A user visiting a specific page
- A form submission
- A fallback (e.g., when the AI can't answer)

### 2. **Actions (Steps)**

Once the flow starts, it can execute any of the following:

- **Send Message**: Text, rich reply, image, or quick reply options.
- **Ask a Question**: Wait for a user reply to proceed.
- **Update Field**: Update a profile field based on conversation data.
- **Call Data Request**: Retrieve third-party data via API based on user input.
- **Send Data Update**: Push user-provided data to an external system.
- **Branch Logic**: Create conditional branches using AND/OR operators.
- **Tag Chat**: Apply labels based on user behavior or flow outcome.
- **Escalate to Agent**: Route to a human when certain conditions are met.
- **End Flow**: Cleanly stop the flow once an outcome is met.

### 3. **Branching**

Use IF/ELSE and AND/OR logic to branch behavior within the flow based on:

- User input
- Tags applied
- Field values
- Previous responses

### 4. **AI Response Integration**

Flows can contain steps that use Aura AI to respond dynamically:

- Ask AI to rephrase
- Provide a smart reply suggestion
- Let AI attempt a fallback before escalating

## Example Use Cases

- **Lead Qualification Flow**:
  - Trigger: Page visit = /pricing
  - Ask name, company size
  - Qualify lead
  - Route to sales agent if enterprise
- **Fallback Escalation Flow**:
  - Trigger: AI fallback tag hit 3 times
  - Show buttons: "Did this help?" / "Talk to a human"
  - If user selects human, escalate chat
- **Booking Flow**:
  - Trigger: Keyword = "demo"
  - Ask availability
  - Call data update API to book meeting

## Flow Builder UX

The Flow Builder UI is:

- **Visual & Drag-and-Drop**
- **Supports nesting & branches**
- **Shows real-time test cases**
- **Lets you preview user paths**
- **Each flow clearly shows entry condition \+ actions \+ exits**

You can:

- Duplicate flows
- Import/export logic
- Preview or test with mock data
- Set flow priority if multiple flows share a trigger

## Best Practices

- Use **clear entry conditions** to avoid unintended triggering.
- Always add **end steps** or escalation to avoid loops.
- Test **all branches** for edge cases.
- Use **tags and profile updates** to track behavior inside flows.

---

## Flow Management

- Flows are stored in the **Automation \> Flows** section.
- You can **enable/disable** individual flows.
- Flows can be tied to multiple **Triggers**.
- You can **prioritize** flows when more than one could apply.

## Roadmap Insights

Coming soon to Flows:

- Time delays and wait steps (e.g., "Wait 5 min before follow-up")
- Variables and templating inside replies
- Conditional looping and retry logic
- Previewing AI decisions inside a flow test

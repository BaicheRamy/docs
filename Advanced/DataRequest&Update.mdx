## What Are Data Requests?

**Data Requests** allow Aura AI to retrieve external data when triggered by specific keywords or intents. This can include pulling user order statuses, account balances, shipment tracking info, or any other API-accessible resource.

### Example Use Cases:

- "Where is my order?" → Fetch tracking status from shipping API.
- "How many points do I have?" → Fetch loyalty balance from CRM.

### How It Works:

- You define an API endpoint in your settings.
- Associate it with one or more trigger keywords.
- When Aura AI detects a matching intent, it automatically sends a GET request and uses the response to craft its reply.

## What Are Data Updates?

**Data Updates** let Aura AI send data to external systems, effectively enabling actions like creating tickets, updating records, or changing a subscription status—all from within the chat.

### Example Use Cases:

- "Cancel my subscription" → POST request to cancel endpoint.
- "Update my phone number" → PATCH request to user profile API.

### How It Works:

- You configure the API endpoint and method (POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.).
- Map the fields that should be sent dynamically from chat input.
- Aura AI detects trigger phrases and performs the action with confirmation.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Go to Settings → Data Requests / Data Updates**
2. **Click “Add New”** and fill in:
   - Endpoint URL
   - Method (GET for requests, POST/PUT for updates)
   - Authorization headers (if required)
   - Dynamic variables (e.g., `{{user_email}}`, `{{order_id}}`)
3. **Set Trigger Keywords** that will prompt Aura AI to use the connection
4. **Test the Connection** before going live

## Best Practices

- Keep endpoints scoped to essential functions to minimize exposure.
- Use secure tokens or OAuth where possible.
- Limit data output to what’s necessary for clarity and compliance.
- Test with various phrasing to ensure Aura AI picks up on user intent effectively.

## Coming Soon

- **Response formatting helpers** for JSON parsing
- **Conditional logic** for fallback replies
- **Support for GraphQL and file upload endpoints**

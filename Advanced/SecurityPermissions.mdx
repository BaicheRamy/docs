## Data Security

Emplorium is designed with privacy and protection in mind. We ensure enterprise-grade security standards across all components:

- **Encryption in Transit & at Rest**: All communications and stored data are encrypted using modern TLS and AES standards.
- **Authentication**: Emplorium supports secure login via email/password, with optional support for third-party auth providers (SAML, OAuth coming soon).
- **Isolation**: Each account’s data is fully isolated to prevent cross-account access or exposure.
- **Data Residency**: Servers are hosted in GDPR-compliant environments (EU-based by default, more regions coming soon).

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Manage permissions at scale with flexible, hierarchical user roles:

- **Admins**: Full access to all settings, integrations, and AI configurations.
- **Agents**: Can reply to conversations, use AI suggestions, and view profiles.
- **Contributors**: Limited to knowledge base management, article creation, and internal notes.
- **Custom Roles (coming soon)**: Fine-tune access rights by permission type (e.g., restrict analytics, API keys, or editing flows).

## User Invitation & Role Assignment

You can invite teammates from the **Settings → Users & Teams** panel:

1. Add an email address and assign a role.
2. Pending users will receive a secure invite link.
3. Users can be edited, deactivated, or removed at any time.

## IP Whitelisting (Planned Feature)

Soon, you’ll be able to restrict access to Emplorium only from trusted IPs, ideal for internal teams or enterprise setups.

## Data Access Logs

View activity logs for sensitive actions like:

- API key generation
- Role changes
- Integration authentication
- Knowledge base updates

These logs help audit usage and enforce accountability in collaborative environments.

## Privacy by Design

- **Session Isolation**: Visitor sessions do not persist across devices or browsers unless explicitly managed by the user.
- **No Cross-Site Tracking**: We do not track users outside your domains.
- **Opt-Out-Friendly**: All widgets and tracking components can be disabled or configured to exclude analytics.

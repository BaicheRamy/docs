## Overview

The Advanced Configuration section in Emplorium empowers administrators to go beyond the basics, offering tools to fine-tune AI behavior, customize visitor targeting, inject dynamic data, and refine escalation logic. This is ideal for users managing complex workflows or high-volume interactions that demand personalization, reliability, and control.

---

## AI Behavior Configuration

### 1. AI Response Style

* Choose between response modes such as:

  * **Professional** (formal, concise)
  * **Conversational** (friendly, informal)
  * **Minimal** (short, data-focused)
* These options affect Aura AI’s tone, sentence length, and intent confidence thresholds.

### 2. AI Fallback Strategy

* Configure how Aura handles uncertainty or failed attempts:

  * **Escalate to Human Agent** after X failed responses.
  * **Offer Help Bubbles** after fallback events.
  * **Tag conversations** with system labels for future analysis.

### 3. AI Escalation Thresholds

* Define thresholds to trigger fallback or human escalation:

  * **Max unanswered questions** (e.g., 3 per conversation)
  * **Flagged intents** (e.g., detected frustration or urgent keywords)

---

## Trigger Logic Enhancements

Advanced users can fine-tune their conditions and logic across flows and triggers:

* **Use AND/OR Logic** to combine conditions like:

  * Visitor page URL contains `pricing` **AND** time spent > 30s
  * Chat started **OR** intent = “book a demo”

* **Nested Logic Support** for more nuanced targeting:

  * Example: If (Location = "France" AND Returning Visitor = true) OR (UTM source = "email-campaign")

* **Custom Visitor Properties** can be created and injected via JavaScript to be used in conditions.

---

## Session Configuration & Privacy

* **Session Timeout Settings**: Control how long visitor sessions are retained before reset.
* **Cookie Behavior**: Toggle Emplorium’s use of cookies for tracking anonymous sessions.
* **Tracking Consent Management**: Show consent banners if GDPR or CCPA applies.

---

## AI Memory & Persistence (Coming Soon)

While Emplorium does not yet support persistent memory across sessions, upcoming features will allow:

* AI to remember prior conversations (opt-in).
* Cross-session profile enrichment.
* Memory reset rules per conversation/session.

---

## Custom Variables & Dynamic Data Injection

Administrators can pass custom variables into the chat widget or session context:

* JavaScript snippet to inject:

```javascript
window.emploriumSettings = {
  visitor_name: "John Doe",
  user_id: "12345",
  subscription_plan: "Premium"
};
```

* These variables are accessible by flows, triggers, and the AI for personalized experiences.

---

## Environment Modes

* **Live Mode**: For production/live visitor interactions.
* **Test Mode**: Used inside the Virtual Visitor tab for simulating visitor conversations and flows without real traffic.
* **Debug Mode**: Show live logs of trigger matches, intent detection, and fallback reason codes.

---

## Best Practices

* **Use Test Mode** before publishing any new flows or triggers.
* Regularly **review fallback tags** to improve AI and rule quality.
* Enable **consent banners** if operating in regulated regions (e.g., EU).
* Inject only **safe and minimal variables** to avoid data leakage.
